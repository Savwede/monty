# 0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Description
The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

## The Monty language
`Monty 0.98` is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. 


# General Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
- All C files are compiled on `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` using `gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89`
- All files ends with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- a maximum of one global variable is allowed
- No more than 5 functions per file
- the use the C standard library is allowed
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called `monty.h`
- All header files should include guards

## Compilation & Output
- the code are compiled this way:
```bash
 gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty
```
- All output are printed on `stdout`
- All error message are printed on `stderr`
